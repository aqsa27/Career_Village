# Career_Village

Your job in this Data Science for Good competition is to develop a recommendation engine that will suggest relevant questions to professionals via email. Students ask questons on the CareerVillage.org platform and Professionals answer them. CareerVillage.org has a pretty good recommendation system inplace that's based on hard-coded rules. They would love to make it more efficient and improve it's performance. That's where you come in :)
Since questions and answers are the main focus of this competition, I thought it would be helpful to join a few tables together to help get things started. This is totally not an exhaustive list of things to do and there's a lot more data to explore so go get wild!

It's all about questions and answer and how to make proper recommendations so these tables might be a good palce to start:
questions.csv
answers.csv
professionals.csv
